        <h2>A little something about me:</h2>
          
            <img id="me" src="./images/aaron.jpg" alt="Aaron">
            <p>My name is Aaron Toys and I'm <strong>35</strong> years old. . . and if I was a Simpson, I'd look like this!</p>
            <p>I was born in Shreveport, LA and lived there until moving to Waltham, MA (a suburb of Boston) to attend Brandeis University. I graduated in 2002 with a BSc in Biology and minors in Antrhopology and Environmental Science. While at Brandeis, I met a South African girl named Nicki. We fell madly in love and moved to South Africa with two suitcases for what was supposed to be a 6 - 12 month working vacation. . . . Twelve years later, we moved back to the US and to Denver with 10 suitcases, 3 kids and a container full of stuff.</p>
            <p>I guess the most important thing that you should know about me is that I am a serial entreprenuer. I've started three businesses in the last ten years. The first, Prime-X Consulting was a moderate success, but I left after only one year. The second, Wicount, was the largest group buying website in South Africa and we were voted one of South Africa's top 20 website for two consecutive years. The last, OfficeEtc, another eCommerce business never gained the traction I had hoped.</p>
            <p>I've decided to go to gSchool because I know how to code just well enough to be dangerous, that is, if I break something, I ususally can't fix it! I'm looking to develop my coding skills so that I am able to build functional products that I hope to be able to take to market or least to MVP level.</p>
